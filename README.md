Python Program to solve Linear Programming using the library PuLP.
What is Linear Programming?
#Linear programming is a mathematical method that is used to determine the best possible outcome or solution from a given set of parameters or list of requirements, which are represented in the form of linear relationships. It is most often used in computer modeling or simulation in order to find the best solution in allocating finite resources such as money, energy, manpower, machine resources, time, space and many other variables. In most cases, the "best outcome" needed from linear programming is maximum profit or lowest cost.
Linear Programming is widely used in our real life daily analysis either to maximize the profit or to minimize the expenditure.
#Business, Agriculture, Military, Financial Management, MArketing Strategic Planning, Media Management, Staff Management, Delivery Management, Shortest Path Calculation etc. are the areas where LINEAR PROGRAMMING is widely used and practically applied.
Advantages of Linear Programming:
1.Optimise the use of resources.
2.Improve Quality of decisions.
3.Helps in where to focus on a particular problem.
4.Time Management.
5.Helps in understanding the changing environment(products,projects,Finance,etc.)
